PAPER (Private Application of Electronic Records) EMR software system

### Short Summary

An EMR System written in Java using a NoSQL (*mongoDB*) backend, with as small a resource footprint as possible.  Initially designed to run with a client/host architecture using a client application deployed to workstations, future releases will support web applications by leveraging the power of Apache Tomcat.  Moreover, these future releases will also support horizontal scaling for both the server application and the database backend, eliminating the hassle of purchasing high-end machines to support a growing RDB.
